# Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 2
# Assignment Goal: explore the National Emissions Inventory database 
# and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the 
# United States over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008

# Datasets: 
# 1) PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds): 
# This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data 
# for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. 
# 2) Source Classification Code Table (Source_Classification_Code.rds): 
# This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions 
# table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source.

# Question 2: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, 
# Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? 
# Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

# If a directory has not been created to hold PM25 data, make one.
if(!file.exists("PM25_Data")) {
    dir.create("PM25_Data")
