#Exploratory Analysis of US EPA National Emissions Data

**Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 2**     
**Taught by Roger Peng PhD., Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health**

##Assignment Goal: 
Explore the National Emissions Inventory database 
and see what it says about fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) in the 
United States over the 10-year period 1999–2008

##Datasets Used in Analysis:
**PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds)**
This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data 
for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

**Source Classification Code Table (Source_Classification_Code.rds)**
This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions 
table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source.

##Contents of this repository
###plot1.R
R script     
Addresses whether emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States 
from 1999 to 2008. Uses the base plotting system to make a plot  
showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002,    
2005, and 2008.

###plot2.R
R script  
Uses the base plotting system to make a plot that addresses whether total emissions   
from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510")  
from 1999 to 2008?

###plot3.R
R script
Uses the ggplot2 plotting system to determine which of the four types of sources    
indicated by the type variable (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) have seen  
decreases/increases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City.

###plot4.R
R script
Uses the ggplot2 system to address how emissions from coal combustion-related sources   
have changed across the United States from 1999–2008?

###plot5.R
R script 
Uses the ggplot2 system to address how emissions from motor vehicle sources have  
changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

###plot6.R
Uses the ggplot2 system to compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore  
City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California  
(fips == "06037") and to determine which city has seen the greatest change in motor  
vehicle emissions over time.
