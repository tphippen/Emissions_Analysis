United States over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008

##Datasets Used in Analysis:
### PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds)
This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data 
for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

### Source Classification Code Table (Source_Classification_Code.rds)
This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions 
table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source.
