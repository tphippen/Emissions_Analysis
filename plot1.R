# Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 2
# Assignment Goal: explore the National Emissions Inventory database 
# and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the 
# United States over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008

# Datasets: 
# 1) PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds): 
# This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data 
# for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. 
# 2) Source Classification Code Table (Source_Classification_Code.rds): 
# This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions 
# table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source.

# Question 1: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States 
# from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing 
# the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 
# 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

# If a directory has not been created to hold PM25 data, make one.
if(!file.exists("PM25_Data")) {
    dir.create("PM25_Data")
}
